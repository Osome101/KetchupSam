 <p>Sam likes ketchup. he is the ketchup leader of the camp, all the campers added ketchup to his hair on the board. Sam didn't like it, so he tried to take it off but the campers kept on drawing it. Since everyone drew ketchup on Sam's head everyone now calls him ketchup Sam. We are now working on a website called ketchup Sam.
