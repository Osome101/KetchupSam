    <p> Ketchup Sam was created when Ohad took a "deep fried" photo of our counsor Sam. When he did he put the photo up on the projector. Us campers drew on him with expo markers and we gave him ketchup hair! We then started making this website. 
        Ketchup Sam is funny, wierd, and always giving me a bad look(not relly though but it fells like it).
        Ketchup Sam is CRAZY!! KETCHUP IS CRAZY! KETCHUP SAM IS CRAZY! But in a good way!
